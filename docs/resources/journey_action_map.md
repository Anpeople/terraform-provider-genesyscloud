## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) Display name of the action map.

- `trigger_with_segments` (Set of String) Trigger action map if any segment in the list is assigned to a given customer.

### Optional

- `end_date` (String) Timestamp at which the action map is scheduled to stop firing. Date time is represented as an ISO-8601 string. For example: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss[.mmm]Z
- `ignore_frequency_cap` (Boolean) Override organization-level frequency cap and always offer web engagements from this action map.
- `is_active` (Boolean) Whether the action map is active. Defaults to `true`.
- `start_date` (String) Timestamp at which the action map is scheduled to start firing. Date time is represented as an ISO-8601 string. For example: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss[.mmm]Z
- `trigger_with_event_conditions` (Block Set) List of event conditions that must be satisfied to trigger the action map. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--trigger_with_event_conditions))
- `trigger_with_outcome_probability_conditions` (Block Set) Probability conditions for outcomes that must be satisfied to trigger the action map. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--trigger_with_outcome_probability_conditions))
- `weight` (Number) Weight of the action map with higher number denoting higher weight.

### Read-Only
